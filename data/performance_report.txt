    --- System Performance Report ---

    Average FPS: 3.93 frames per second
    Average mAP (Accuracy): 0.75

    Strengths:
    - High FPS indicating real-time processing capability.
    - Accurate detection (high mAP) in controlled environments.

    Limitations:
    - Reduced detection accuracy under challenging conditions:
      * Crowded Scenes: Moderate (mAP ~ 0.65)
      * Low-light/Varied Lighting: Low (mAP ~ 0.5)

    Recommendations:
    - Improve model robustness by training with diverse datasets including crowded and low-light scenes.
    - Consider using higher-performing hardware if FPS is too low for real-time requirements.
